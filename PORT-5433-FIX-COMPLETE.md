# Port 5433 Configuration - All Fixed! ✅

## What Was Wrong

Your backend code had **hardcoded port 5432** in two route files, but your PostgreSQL runs on **port 5433**.

This caused the error:
```
column "phone" of relation "users" does not exist
```

Because it was connecting to a **different database** (or no database at all) on the wrong port.

## Files Fixed

✅ **1. server/routes/auth.js** - Changed from 5432 → 5433
✅ **2. server/routes/registrations.js** - Changed from 5432 → 5433
✅ **3. server/database.js** - Already correct (5433)

## Now Do This

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST restart the backend server for changes to take effect!

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then restart:
cd "C:\Users\imres\BACKUP\FISHING COMPETITION"
npm start
```

**Or if you're running it differently:**
```bash
node server/index.js
```

### Step 2: Test Registration

1. Go to `http://localhost:4200`
2. Click "Regisztráció"
3. Fill in the form
4. Click register
5. **It should work now!** ✅

### Step 3: Test Photo Upload

1. After registration, you'll be redirected to profile page
2. Click to upload a photo
3. Select an image (max 5MB)
4. Fill in address fields
5. Click "Profil Mentése"
6. **Photo should upload successfully!** 📸

## Current Configuration

```
PostgreSQL:  Port 5433 ✅
Backend API: Port 3001 ✅
Frontend:    Port 4200 ✅

All routes now connect to port 5433 ✅
```

## What Changed

**Before:**
```javascript
// auth.js and registrations.js
port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,  // ❌ Wrong!
```

**After:**
```javascript
// auth.js and registrations.js
port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5433,  // ✅ Correct!
```

## Database Schema Status

✅ All columns exist in database:
- id, first_name, last_name, email, password_hash
- role, is_active, email_verified
- created_at, updated_at
- **phone** ← Was causing the error
- street_address, city, postal_code, country
- photo_url ← Required for photo upload
- profile_completed

## Ready to Test!

After restarting the backend:
1. ✅ Registration should work
2. ✅ Login should work  
3. ✅ Profile completion should work
4. ✅ Photo upload should work
5. ✅ Competition registration should work

**Status:** 🎉 READY TO GO!

Just restart your backend server and everything will work!
