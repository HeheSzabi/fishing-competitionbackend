# Port Configuration Fix

## Issue
All frontend services were configured to connect to port **3001**, but the backend server runs on port **3000**.

## Files Fixed

### Backend (Correct - No changes needed)
- `server/index.js` - Runs on port 3000 ✅

### Frontend (Updated to port 3000)
1. ✅ `client/src/app/services/auth.service.ts`
2. ✅ `client/src/app/services/registration.service.ts`
3. ✅ `client/src/app/services/competition.service.ts`
4. ✅ `client/src/app/services/weigh-in.service.ts`
5. ✅ `client/src/app/services/participant.service.ts`
6. ✅ `client/src/app/services/results.service.ts`
7. ✅ `client/src/app/components/profile-completion/profile-completion.component.ts`

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Angular Development Server

**In your terminal where Angular is running:**
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the dev server
2. Run `ng serve` again

**Or if using npm:**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd client
ng serve
```

### Step 2: Make Sure Backend is Running

**In another terminal:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd "C:\Users\imres\BACKUP\FISHING COMPETITION"

# Start the backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
Server running on port 3000
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Go to `http://localhost:4200`
2. Register a new user
3. You'll be redirected to profile completion page
4. Try uploading a photo
5. **It should now work!** ✅

## Current Configuration

```
Frontend (Angular): http://localhost:4200
Backend (Express):  http://localhost:3000

All API calls now correctly point to: http://localhost:3000/api/*
```

## What Was the Problem?

The error `POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/profile/photo 404 (Not Found)` occurred because:
- Frontend was trying to connect to port **3001**
- Backend was running on port **3000**
- Result: 404 Not Found

## Solution Applied

Changed all API URLs from:
```typescript
'http://localhost:3001/api/*'
```

To:
```typescript
'http://localhost:3000/api/*'
```

## Verification Checklist

After restarting the Angular server:
- [ ] No console errors on page load
- [ ] Can login/register
- [ ] Can view competitions
- [ ] Can upload profile photo
- [ ] Photo appears in preview
- [ ] Profile saves successfully

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Restart Angular server to apply
